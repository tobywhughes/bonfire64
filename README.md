This emulator's first purpose is to serve as a learning tool for the author. The second purpose is to serve as a learning tool for others.

This means that large strides will be taken towards extensive documentation and readable code in the process of creating this emulator.

However, as it is also serving as a learning tool for the author, there are logical limitations of that, and any of the above stated goals will be worked towards within reason.
The current state of the code is not representative of what the end goal may be and in it's current state, large changes may be required.

Also, because of this serving as a learning project, this project is not currently allowing outside contributors nor fixing any issues in the issue tracker relating to the actual function of the emulator.

That said, if you see an error in the code, feel free to create an issue on the issue tracker. 
Also, if part of the documentation or code is confusing feel free to open an issue as that can help me work towards improving the project as a learning tool.
