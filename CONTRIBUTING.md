This project is not currently accepting contributors. Issues can be made in the issue tracker, but in the current state, this is purely an act of of goodwill of the contributor pointing out errors rather than any actionable bugfix request. These raised issues are appreciated, but the author gives no guarantee that these issues will be handled in a timely manner.

An exception to the above statement is request for documentation. While there is still no gaurantee that these will be added in a timely manner, as this project is intended to be used as a learning resource as a primary goal, these requests will be treated with substantially higher priority.

If you wish to contribute, please check back in the future.
